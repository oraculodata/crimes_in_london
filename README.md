This project aims to assist those who plan to visit London or those who live in London. With this app, you can walk in the least risky areas to ensure your safety, avoiding places with higher security risks.

The data has been extracted from [https://data.police.uk/about](https://data.police.uk/data/archive/latest.zip), so they are real data.

> This project is currently under development. I will soon release the version with connections to MySQL and Snowflake, along with the historical crime data loading routine. Additionally, I will provide the link to access the application.
